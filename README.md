# Image-Stitching

Instruction to run the code:

1. Place every image in the dataset in the current folder.
2. Run 'image_stitching.py' to see the output images of inbuilt as well as own-implementation of homography estimation for all the folders. Separately run the plotting code for a specific folder by commenting the plottting of the other folder outputs, if needed.

Thank you!
